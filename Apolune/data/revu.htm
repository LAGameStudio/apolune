<A NAME="Remarks">  </A>
<H1> Other remarks: </H1>
<UL >
<LI><b>Revu&#153;</b> can only be used to read text files. It can never be used to revise text files.
<LI><b>Revu&#153;</b> is implicitly used by <b>r4&#153;</b> and <b>roo!&#153;</b> for source presentation
during interactive tracing. The current line is continually updated, as the program is debugged. When
the program being debugged concludes, the associated <b>Revu&#153;</b> window is automatically closed.
<LI>RevuAlt.Exe is also available. You can customize the size of the font by setting
the REVU_FONT_SIZE environment variable to the desired font size.
<BR>The following sets the font size to 16.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;set REF_FONT_SIZE=16
<BR>The default alternate font size is 12.
<LI><b>Clipboard actions:</b>
<UL >
<LI>Ctrl-C copies the selected line to the clipboard.
<LI>Shift-Ctrl-C begins a block copy.
<BR>The highlighted line of the block copy has a yellow on dark purple line number.
<BR>The copy-to line can be before the highlighted line.
<BR>A Ctrl-C concludes the block copy.
<LI>Ctrl-1, Ctrl-2, ..., Ctrl-9 copies word #1, ..., 9 of the selected line to the clipboard
</UL>
<LI><b>File name, or command, actions:</b>
<BR>File name actions are on the first text in the line
<UL >
<LI>Ctrl-B browses the file with a new Revu&#153; window
<BR>The file name can be followed by a target line number in square brackets.
<LI>Ctrl-E edits the file - with the editor of the file extension
<LI>Ctrl-O opens the file - with the program associated with the file extension
<LI>Ctrl-L launches the selected line as a command
</UL>
<P>The following batch file can be used to show the standard output of one or more
console commands using Revu&#153; instead of the standard <b>more</b> command.
In this example the batch file is named !!.bat. That file must be in a directory
established by the PATH environment variable.
<P>The <b>cat.exe</b> program is provided by Kilowatt Software LLC. It is an emulation of the
standard UNIX <b>cat</b> command. You can use other implementations of the <b>cat</b> command
instead.
<P>In the following &lt;cmd+&gt; represents one or more console commands. Shazam is a
text segment that will appear as the caption of the Revu&#153; window.
<ul><TABLE border=1 cellspacing=5 width=80%><TR><TD>
<BR>@echo off
<BR>rem
<BR>rem replaces 'more' with 'revu' !
<BR>rem
<BR>rem usage: &lt;cmd+&gt; | !! Shazam
<BR>cat &gt; %tmp%\_%1.txt
